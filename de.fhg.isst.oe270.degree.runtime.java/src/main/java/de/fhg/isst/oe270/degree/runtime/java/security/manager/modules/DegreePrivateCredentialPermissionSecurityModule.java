     * The javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission class is used to protect access to
     * private Credentials belonging to a particular Subject. The Subject is represented by a Set of
     * Principals. The target name of this Permission specifies a Credential class name, and a Set
     * of Principals. The only valid value for this Permission's actions is, "read". The target name
     * must abide by the following syntax:
     * <p>
     * CredentialClass {PrincipalClass "PrincipalName"}* For example, the following permission
     * grants access to the com.sun.PrivateCredential owned by Subjects which have a
     * com.sun.Principal with the name, "duke". Note: Although this example, as well as all the
     * examples below, do not contain Codebase, SignedBy, or Principal information in the grant
     * statement (for simplicity reasons), actual policy configurations should specify that
     * information when appropriate.
     * <p>
     * grant { permission javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission "com.sun.PrivateCredential
     * com.sun.Principal \"duke\"", "read"; }; If CredentialClass is "*", then access is granted to
     * all private Credentials belonging to the specified Subject. If "PrincipalName" is "*", then
     * access is granted to the specified Credential owned by any Subject that has the specified
     * Principal (the actual PrincipalName doesn't matter). For example, the following grants access
     * to the a.b.Credential owned by any Subject that has an a.b.Principal. grant { permission
     * javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission "a.b.Credential a.b.Principal "*"", "read";
     * }; If both the PrincipalClass and "PrincipalName" are "*", then access is granted to the
     * specified Credential owned by any Subject. In addition, the PrincipalClass/PrincipalName
     * pairing may be repeated: grant { permission javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission
     * "a.b.Credential a.b.Principal "duke" c.d.Principal "dukette"", "read"; }; The above code
     * grants access to the private Credential, "a.b.Credential", belonging to a Subject with at
     * least two associated Principals: "a.b.Principal" with the name, "duke", and "c.d.Principal",
     * with the name, "dukette".
