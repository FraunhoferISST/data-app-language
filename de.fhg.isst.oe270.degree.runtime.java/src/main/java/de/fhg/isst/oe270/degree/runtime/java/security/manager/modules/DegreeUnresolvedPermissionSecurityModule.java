     * The java.security.UnresolvedPermission class is used to hold Permissions that were
     * "unresolved" when the Policy was initialized. An unresolved permission is one whose actual
     * Permission class does not yet exist at the time the Policy is initialized (see below).
     * <p>
     * The policy for a Java runtime (specifying which permissions are available for code from
     * various principals) is represented by a Policy object. Whenever a Policy is initialized or
     * refreshed, Permission objects of appropriate classes are created for all permissions allowed
     * by the Policy.
     * <p>
     * Many permission class types referenced by the policy configuration are ones that exist
     * locally (i.e., ones that can be found on CLASSPATH). Objects for such permissions can be
     * instantiated during Policy initialization. For example, it is always possible to instantiate
     * a java.io.FilePermission, since the FilePermission class is found on the CLASSPATH.
     * <p>
     * Other permission classes may not yet exist during Policy initialization. For example, a
     * referenced permission class may be in a JAR file that will later be loaded. For each such
     * class, an UnresolvedPermission is instantiated. Thus, an UnresolvedPermission is essentially
     * a "placeholder" containing information about the permission.
     * <p>
     * Later, when code calls AccessController.checkPermission on a permission of a type that was
     * previously unresolved, but whose class has since been loaded, previously-unresolved
     * permissions of that type are "resolved". That is, for each such UnresolvedPermission, a new
     * object of the appropriate class type is instantiated, based on the information in the
     * UnresolvedPermission. This new object replaces the UnresolvedPermission, which is removed.
     *
     * @param permission the UnresolvedPermission which will be checked
     * @return a list of required permissions
     * @see UnresolvedPermission
