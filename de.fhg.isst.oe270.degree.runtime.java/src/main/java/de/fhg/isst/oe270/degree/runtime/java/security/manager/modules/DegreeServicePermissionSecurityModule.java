     * The javax.security.auth.kerberos.ServicePermission class is used to protect Kerberos services
     * and the credentials necessary to access those services. There is a one to one mapping of a
     * service principal and the credentials necessary to access the service. Therefore granting
     * access to a service principal implicitly grants access to the credential necessary to
     * establish a security context with the service principal. This applies regardless of whether
     * the credentials are in a cache or acquired via an exchange with the KDC. The credential can
     * be either a ticket granting ticket, a service ticket or a secret key from a key table. A
     * ServicePermission contains a service principal name and a list of actions which specify the
     * context the credential can be used within.
     * <p>
     * The service principal name is the canonical name of the KereberosPrincipal supplying the
     * service, that is the KerberosPrincipal represents a Kerberos service principal. This name is
     * treated in a case sensitive manner.
     * <p>
     * Granting this permission implies that the caller can use a cached credential (Ticket Granting
     * Ticket, service ticket or secret key) within the context designated by the action. In the
     * case of the TGT, granting this permission also implies that the TGT can be obtained by an
     * Authentication Service exchange.
     * <p>
     * For example, to specify the permission to access to the TGT to initiate a security context
     * the permission is constructed as follows: ServicePermission("krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM",
     * "initiate"); To obtain a service ticket to initiate a context with the "host" service the
     * permission is constructed as follows: ServicePermission("host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM",
     * "initiate"); For a Kerberized server the action is "accept". For example, the permission
     * necessary to access and use the secret key of the Kerberized "host" service (telnet and the
     * likes) would be constructed as follows: ServicePermission("host/foo.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM",
     * "accept");
     *
     * @param permission the ServicePermission which will be checked
     * @return a list of required permissions
