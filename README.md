      Data App Programming Language
</h1>

The data app programming language (named D° [spoken dəˈɡrē]) is a work result of the PhD of [Fabian Bruckner](https://github.com/nazzrim).
It is a domain specific language with integrated usage control mechanisms.
The language's intended usage is the development of data processing applications.
D° uses Java as host language and is highly extensible.

The docs folder contains multiple deliverables, which have been created in the Fraunhofer-Cluster of
Excellence “Cognitive Internet Technologies”.
All documents in this folder are in german.
